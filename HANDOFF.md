## GPU box quick-state (live probe)
```
BOX UNREACHABLE (auth lapsed? box down?) — ask Daniel: ! gcloud auth login
```
If any docker container named renderer/model/ncap (or a random-name ncap) is up, a run
is IN FLIGHT — identify it from the newest /var/log/sentinel-*.log and DO NOT relaunch.

## Open threads (from the newest experiment docs)
- Newest pre-registration: experiments/iter33_prefix_preserving_bridge_intervention/HYPOTHESIS.md — read it in full; its gate governs the next action.
- Next research launch packet: docs/research/CAUSAL_PLANNER_INTERPRETABILITY.md — not a pre-registration; it authorizes no run.
- docs/NEXT_PHASE.md: check its status ledger/decision rules.
- docs/paper/MANUSCRIPT.md: check its status ledger/decision rules.

## Verification before you act
- Run: ruff check . && pytest -q && python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
- All three must pass before and after your changes; CI enforces the same on push.
