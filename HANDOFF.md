## Repository state
```
9d28d5c docs: record iter44 no-repair smoothing verdict in README header/tracker/diagram/status and CONTINUITY arc + shift log
f958d25 iter44: publish VELOCITY_SMOOTHING_NO_REPAIR_NULL — all four frozen estimators fail baseline fidelity and jitter repair; over-firing halves but never reaches the bar
baf0da2 iter44: collect single-run smoothing-gate proof — report JSON, command record, local verification
507a757 iter44: add velocity-smoothing gate analyzer importing the iter42 replay and iter43 perturbation modules, plus unit tests
e19a4af iter44: pre-register offline velocity temporal-smoothing repair gate over the committed iter42 trace
d9b814f handoff: refresh after iter43 object-stream perturbation gate; box idle and untouched
20805b4 docs: record iter43 mild-fragile perturbation verdict in README header/tracker/diagram/status and CONTINUITY arc + shift log
9f960d4 iter43: publish OBJECT_PERTURBATION_MILD_FRAGILE — jitter fragile at 0.05/0.10 m (over-firing dominant), dropout/score/churn stable at mild levels
```

If any docker container named renderer/model/ncap (or a random-name ncap) is up, a run
is IN FLIGHT — identify it from the newest /var/log/sentinel-*.log and DO NOT relaunch.

## Open threads (from the newest experiment docs)
- Newest completed experiment: experiments/iter44_velocity_smoothing_gate/RESULT.md — read it before opening new work.
- Next research launch packet: docs/research/CAUSAL_PLANNER_INTERPRETABILITY.md — not a pre-registration; it authorizes no run.
- docs/NEXT_PHASE.md: check its status ledger/decision rules.
- docs/paper/MANUSCRIPT.md: check its status ledger/decision rules.

## Verification before you act
- Run: ruff check . && pytest -q && python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
- All three must pass before and after your changes; CI enforces the same on push.
